### New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.

#### Quotes From The Article

<br>

> In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

>  Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

> No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.

> Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

> Understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. 

> What distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

> Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

> In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency.

> Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety.

>  There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability.

> The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

- Having a team of competent people is surely important to have a successful team, but what matters more is that poeple who work together get to know each other, respect each other and their work.

- Teammates ought to set `guidelines` for their work and interactions, not supposedly strict, but enough to organize discussions and work sessions.

- Understanding and organization tend to increase team productivity more than individual skills.
