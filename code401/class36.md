## Readings from [Whiteboard Interview Advice](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

<br>

### The Advice: Communicate!

<br>

> The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate!

<br>

### What Do You Mean Communicate?

<br>

> Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.

<br>

#### First, Restate the Question

<br>

> Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it.

> Restate the question for them and seek affirmation.

> You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

> The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand.

> Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge.

<br>

#### Ask About Edge Cases

<br>

> hink for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

> Ask about them.

> In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

<br>

#### Ask About Test Cases

<br>

> This is free and you should take advantage of it.

> Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

> Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. 

<br>

#### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

<br>

> Let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

> (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well).

> You can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer.

> In the worst case the interviewer will tell you to continue without actually offering feedback.

> In the best case, the interviewer might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.

<br>

#### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

<br>

> You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.

> You don’t even need to remove the comments.

> At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.

> If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief.

> If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

<br>

#### Stuck? Ask for Help!

<br>

> If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. 

<br>

#### Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview

<br>

> You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview.

> Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them!

> They might tell you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard — very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least, mentally prepare.

<br>

#### We’re All Human

<br>

> Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview.

> Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner.

## Readings from [7 tips to ace a programming interview](https://medium.com/@steve_45636/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

<br>

#### Take a few minutes

<br>

> Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews.

> The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”.

<br>

> Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

> Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions.

> Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach.

> Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded.

<br>

#### Write down the steps of the solution

<br>

> Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down.

> Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.

> You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

<br>

#### Write pseudocode first

<br>

> Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode.

> Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away.

> write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work.

> Even if we never make it to writing code, many interviewers will consider this a solution to the problem.

<br>

#### Don’t sweat the small stuff

<br>

> Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet.

> They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities.

> If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

> Half of being a programmer is knowing how to Google stuff and how to interpret search results. 

<br>

#### Sit down. Be humble

<br>

> A programming interview isn’t just a written exam.

> It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.

> If you are given criticism in an interview, you need to take it and be grateful for it.'

<br>

#### Come prepared

<br>

> When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat).

> It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards.

> In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

<br>

#### Review your work

<br>

> You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution.

> If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”.

> Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review.

- In particular, focus on these two areas, as they receive heavy scrutiny in interviews:
  - Algorithmic efficiency
    - Have you found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements?
    - Take some time and consider other approaches.
  - Correctness
    - Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? Off-by-one errors? Issues with negative numbers or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters?
