# OSS Contributions

<br>

## Readings from [FIRST TIMERS ONLY](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

<br>

### Conclusion

<br>

> First timer contributions are normally very small and easy.

> This makes it easier for the contributor to get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself.

> This isn’t as much about getting your project features implemented quickly as it is about helping first timers.

> `first-timers-only` Label is important, because it makes a statement that first timers are welcome, that they are valued, and that they can start contributing to your project!

## Readings from [What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)

<br>

### Improve Coding Skills

<br>

> The only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice.

> For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. 

> In order to help young programmers improve their skills, a number of OSS projects now include tickets designed for aspiring programmers to gain genuine programming experience

<br>

### Gain Early Experience

<br>

> OSS provides young developers with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even for internships and entry-level positions.

> Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.

> Gaining real experience before applying for an internship can not only help secure a position at a well-sought-after tech company, but can also help move you into full-time work and accelerate your career.

<br>

### Increase Community and Peer Recognition

<br>

> Recognition from members from the OSS community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve his or her skills, it can also create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events, etc.

<br>

### Greater Job Prospects

<br>

> Nowadays, when many tech companies receive a CV from a prospective developer, they usually skim over the sheets of paper and spend more time investigating the applicant’s Github account.

> The fact that OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written.

<br>

### Improve Software on a User and Business Level

<br>

> A lot of the time, developers first come across OSS as users. In this case, the desire to contribute to this particular piece of OSS stems from wanting to improve it for their own use – either by improving certain areas or by developing new features and functionalities.

> This desire to contribute can also resonate on a business level. If a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need, then this is also a real possibility.
