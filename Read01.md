# Markdown Syntax

<br>

## What is "Markdown Syntax"?
Think of Markdown as a set of tools that allow you to present your web text content easily and proficiently, without the need to learn an entire new language or clogging your text with tags and text blocks.

So, instead of typing something like `<b> Bold text </b> ` you can just type it like this `** Bold Text**` and you should get **the same expected results!**

<br>

## How Efficient is using Markdown Syntax?
This could expand into many more functions made easier, take this as an example:
- You can type faster!
- You don't have to worry about forgetting to close tags!
- Many online platforms adapted Markdown and are compatible with most of its' functions in some way or another!


Just here, I used Markdown syntax instead of HTML tags to create the previous list, and it looks like this in `MD`:
```
- You can type faster!
- You don't have to worry about forgetting to close tags!
- Many online platforms adapted Markdown and are compatible with most of its' functions in some way or another.
```
Instead of this in `HTML`:

```
<ul>
<li> You can type faster! </li>
<li> You don't have to worry about forgetting to close tags! </li>
<li> Many online platforms adapted Markdown and are compatible with most of its' functions in some way or another. </li>
</ul>
```
So, you could only imagine how much time and effort you can save when you're creating an actual piece of serious work.

## What else can I use Markdown Syntax with?
Well, technically, your options are limitless, despite how Markdown Syntax are limited, you can be creative to represent your work and ideas in any form and shape you like!
- [ ] You!
- [ ] Can!
- [ ] Create!
- [x] Checklists!

Document and organize your ~~past~~ ***present work*** information!

- In nested lists!
    - And more!

## Can I use Markdown Syntax all the time?

Note that Markdown Syntax can not fully replace a complete language such as HTML, but it makes your work much fun and easier where it is applicable, should you use it to format and convey your work information accurately.
